HEY
This Script Auto Installs Best Mods For Skyblock (1.8.9) Forge!
If u have forge 1.8.9 already installed, Please Double Click On "ModsOnly/ModsUpdater.bat"
Or If u dont have forge 1.8.9 installer, click on "ForgeAndModsInstaller.bat"
To Update Your Mods to latest version, weekly run "ModsOnly/ModsUpdater.bat"
After running the script all of ur old mods will be moved to new folder called 'modsbackup' in .minecraft folder.
You can copy your old mods anytime back from that folder :)
When clicking on .bat, if notepad opens, DO NOT EDIT ANYTHING, and close the notepad and run the .bat file as administrator using right click on file.
Also wget.exe is necessary so do not delete it.
If any problem occurs try contacting me :)
